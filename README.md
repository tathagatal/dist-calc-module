# dist-calc-module
to calculate distance between two pincodes/zipcodes
Calculation of distance between the pincodes of the suppliers and consumers is one of the key parameters for selection critera. Provided we have both suppliers and consumers pin code - an idea would be conversion of pincodes into latitude and longitude so that ditnace between the two picodes can be calculated.
Country level pincodes/zipcodes can be obtained from Geonames.org. WIP
